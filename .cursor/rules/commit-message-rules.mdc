# Commit Message Rules

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Rules

1. Header (first line):
   - Must be ≤ 72 characters
   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
   - No period at the end
   - Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")

2. Body:
   - Must be ≤ 100 characters per line
   - Each line must be a complete thought
   - Be descriptive and provide context
   - Optional: Use bullet points for better readability when listing multiple changes
   - Make small, focused commits that can be easily reviewed

3. Types:
   - build: Changes to build system
   - chore: Maintenance tasks
   - ci: CI configuration changes
   - docs: Documentation changes
   - feat: New features
   - fix: Bug fixes
   - perf: Performance improvements
   - refactor: Code refactoring
   - revert: Revert changes
   - style: Code style changes
   - test: Test changes

## Examples

✅ Good (with bullet points for multiple changes):

```text
feat(ui): add cursor-pointer to interactive elements

Changes include:
- Add cursor-pointer to all buttons
- Update hover states for better feedback
- Ensure consistent behavior across themes
```

✅ Good (without bullet points for focused change):

```text
fix(auth): resolve login token expiration

Update token refresh logic to prevent premature expiration
Add proper error handling for expired tokens
```

❌ Bad (exceeds character limits):

```text
feat(ui): add cursor-pointer to all interactive buttons

Update Button component to ensure pointer feedback for better UX. No visual regression, only improved user experience.
```

> **Note:** When the AI generates a commit, it MUST follow the workflow defined in [ai-commit-workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai-commit-workflow.mdc). The commit message body is optional.
