description: Enforces Conventional Commit format and commitlint rules for all commit messages created by the AI or users. Ensures all commit messages are in English and follow project
alwaysApply: false
---

- All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commit format.
- The header (first line) must be ≤ 72 characters, imperative mood, no period at the end.
- The body (optional) must be ≤ 100 characters per line, each line a complete thought.
- Allowed types: build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test.
- Use bullet points in the body for multiple changes.
- Make small, focused commits that are easy to review.
- All commit messages and comments must be written in English.

## Examples

✅ Good (with bullet points for multiple changes):

```text
feat(ui): add cursor-pointer to interactive elements

Changes include:
- Add cursor-pointer to all buttons
- Update hover states for better feedback
- Ensure consistent behavior across themes
```

✅ Good (without bullet points for focused change):

```text
fix(auth): resolve login token expiration

Update token refresh logic to prevent premature expiration
```

❌ Bad (exceeds character limits):

```text
feat(ui): add cursor-pointer to all interactive buttons for improved user experience

Update Button component to ensure pointer feedback for better UX. No visual regression, only improved user experience.
```
