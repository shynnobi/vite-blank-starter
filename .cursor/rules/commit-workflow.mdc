# Commit Workflow

## Pre-commit Checklist

Before creating any commit, the AI must:

1. Check git status to identify:
   - Staged files
   - Modified files
   - Untracked files

2. Verify that only relevant files are staged for the current commit:
   - Files must be logically related to the commit message
   - No unrelated changes should be included
   - No documentation or configuration files unless explicitly part of the change

3. If unrelated files are staged:
   - Unstage all files using `git reset HEAD .`
   - Review changes again
   - Stage only the relevant files for the current commit

4. Before committing:
   - Double-check the staged files match the commit's purpose
   - Ensure commit message follows conventions (see commit-message.mdc)
   - Verify no linting errors in staged files

## Error Prevention

- See expected-AI-behavior.mdc for rules regarding the use of --no-verify.
- If commit fails due to linting errors:
  1. Fix the errors
  2. Stage the fixed files
  3. Try committing again
- If wrong files were committed:
  1. Use `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
  2. Review and restage correct files
  3. Create new commit with proper message
