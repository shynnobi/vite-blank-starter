- Conventional commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, etc.)
- Precise and technical description of changes
- Small, focused commits that can be easily reviewed
- Respect commitlint restrictions:
  - The commit title (header) must not exceed 72 characters
  - Each line of the commit body must not exceed 100 characters
- Never use --no-verify flag without explicit user permission
- Fix linting and type errors before committing rather than bypassing checks
