# AI Pair Programming & Cursor Rules

## Introduction

This starter is optimized for both traditional and AI-powered workflows, with a special focus on enhancing the developer experience when using AI pair programming tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/). The `.cursor/rules` directory contains a set of structured rules that guide the AI assistant to follow best practices, project conventions, and team standards, while maintaining compatibility with traditional development approaches.

## Why AI Pair Programming?

- Accelerates development by providing intelligent code suggestions and automation.
- Ensures consistency by enforcing project-specific standards and workflows.
- Facilitates onboarding and knowledge sharing for new contributors.
- Complements traditional development practices without replacing them.

## How Cursor Rules Work

Cursor reads the rules in `.cursor/rules/` to adapt its behavior as your AI pair programmer.
Each rule file describes a specific aspect of the workflow, coding standards, or communication protocol.

## Overview of Rule Files

- **code-standards.mdc**: Coding standards for the project (e.g., TypeScript, React, naming conventions).
- **development-methodology.mdc**: Methodologies to follow (e.g., TDD, atomic commits, SoC).
- **expected-AI-behavior.mdc**: How the AI should interact, suggest, and validate code.
- **github-cli-integration.mdc**: How to use GitHub CLI efficiently in the workflow.
- **github-pr-conventions.mdc**: Pull request standards and templates.
- **git-practices.mdc**: Commit message conventions and best practices.
- **interaction-protocol.mdc**: How the AI should communicate and interact with the user.
- **language-policy.mdc**: Language and naming conventions for code and documentation.
- **documentation-versioning.mdc**: How to manage documentation and versioning.
- **project-architecture-principles.mdc**: Architectural guidelines for the project.
- **ecosystem-convention.mdc**: How to align with ecosystem and tool-specific conventions.
- **technical-AI-posture.mdc**: The expected technical rigor and posture of the AI assistant.

## Customizing AI Behavior

You can edit or add rules in `.cursor/rules/` to tailor the AI's behavior to your team's needs.
For example, you can enforce stricter code review, change commit message formats, or adapt the interaction style.

## Best Practices

- Keep rules concise and focused on one topic per file.
- Update rules as your project evolves or as your team's workflow changes.
- Review the rules with your team to ensure alignment.

**In summary:**
The `.cursor/rules` directory is the backbone of the AI pair programming experience in this starter.
It ensures that every contributor—human or AI—follows the same high standards and workflow, making collaboration seamless and efficient.
